# RustyTerm

RustyTerm aims to be the most complete terminall of them all. 

Featuring the best plugin for every command, and the greatest look, RustyTerminal wants to be the best in his business. But any house can be started from the top, it 
has to be started from the foundations, currently it's a quite simple terminal, featuring a reduced number of commands and features.
Follow the releases to know what's included in each release and to see that commands are getting added to the terminal as the new versions appear.

**Currently, RustyTerm is only available on macOS, of course in future versions we will add support for Linux and Windows, the last one is not 100% sure but the support for Linux will come surely, but keep in mind that we actually prioritise the functionality rather than the availability on multiple OSs**
